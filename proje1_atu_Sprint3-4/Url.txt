The project has undergone some updates and enhancements.
jQuery plugins have been integrated to provide better user 
interactivity and experience. In situations where some widgets
were not functioning as expected, they have been left 
commented out in the code for reference. Two AJAX requests
have been utilized in this project. The first one fetches
weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api).
This helps to provide real-time weather updates for the users.
The second AJAX request fetches content for the "Courses" section
of the website from three different .txt files
 (course1.txt, course2.txt, and course3.txt). This allows 
 dynamic updating of the course information directly from 
 the server without the need to modify the main HTML file.



Here are the plugins and jQuery functionalities implemented:
fadeIn() and setTimeout()
scroll()
owlCarousel()
hover()
Slick (currently deactivated but code exists): This plugin was initially planned to be used for creating a slick, responsive carousel but is currently not in use.
jQuery Validation
Dialog Plugin



This website serves as a comprehensive platform designed to
introduce and represent a university. It is developed with 
an emphasis on versatility, enabling users to gather significant
information about the university and establish direct communication 
seamlessly. The design of the website boasts a contemporary
aesthetic that aligns with its highly functional architecture.

The project is thoughtfully designed with the needs of the 
stakeholders in mind, with the goal of delivering a fun and dynamic
user experience. It uses AJAX to enable real-time data changes, which
in turn provides dynamic content and dramatically raises user engagement.

Our goal as we look to the future is to continuously improve and 
increase the functionality and interaction of the website. We strive
to consistently meet and above user expectations in order to maintain 
the website as a crucial and beneficial tool for all of its users.
